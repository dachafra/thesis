%\epigraph{Computer scientists do not make research, they solve real problems}{\textit{Isabel Fraga}}

In this Chapter, we introduce our contributions that exploit declarative annotations over data on the web for enhancing the construction of virtual knowledge graphs. The two frameworks presented apply the \textit{mapping translation} concept defined in Chapter \ref{chapter:mappig-translation} for improving the current proposals. 

Section \ref{chap6_morphgcsv} presents Morph-CSV, a constraint-based approach for ensuring the effectiveness of SPARQL-to-SQL when the input tabular data is not a relational database instance. It uses RML+FnO mapping rules and CSVW metadata descriptions to explicitly declare implicit constraints over the input sources. Section \ref{chap6_morphgraphql} describes Morph-GraphQL, a framework that adapts the SPARQL-to-SQL algorithm presented in~\citep{chebotko2009semantics} to automate the generation of programmer data wrappers from declarative mapping rules. More in detail, it is focused on generating GraphQL resolvers for virtual access to relational databases using R2RML mappings as inputs.
