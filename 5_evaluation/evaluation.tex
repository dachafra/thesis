\chapter{Systematic Evaluation for Knowledge Graph Construction Systems}
\label{chapter:evaluation}
In this chapter, we present the contributions related with the evaluation of knowledge graph construction systems. To facilitate data exploitation in this context, application developers need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of existing knowledge graph construction tools. Additionally, tool developers may want to know if their engines cover the requirements of real use-case scenarios. In general, it is necessary to have an overview of state of the art engines that are tailored to different source formats, accepting as input mappings that are represented in a variety of declarative languages. 

In summary, Section \ref{chapter5:sec-bench} presents a virtual knowledge graph construction benchmark over the transport domain. Additionally to the benchmark proposal, the contribution is evaluated over five different engines from the state of the art. Section \ref{chapter5:sec-rml} describes a preliminary set of test cases for testing the conformance of RML mapping language over its available processors, and finally, Section \ref{chapter5:sec-param} describes and analyzes the impact of several parameters for the evaluation of materialized KGC engines together with the definition of a set of representative testbeds and their evaluation over two compliant RML engines.
