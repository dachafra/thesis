\label{chap:objectives}
As discussed in the previous chapters, in our work we focus on the exploitation of declarative mapping rules for the construction of knowledge graphs from heterogeneous data sources. Additionally, in order to provide a proper and objective evaluation of these kind of systems, we propose and design a set of methodologies and benchmarks to address this issue. This chapter presents the objectives of our work and our contributions to the current state of the art. We also enumerate the assumptions considered when we started this work, and describe the most relevant hypothesis and restrictions that delimit the scope of this thesis.

\section{Objectives}
In the context of this thesis we identify two different goals. First, we propose the concept of \textit{mapping translation} and describe its main properties. Exploiting this concept, and, bringing out a new generation of knowledge graph construction systems, we describe two systems that construct virtual knowledge graphs (\textit{Morph-CSV} and \textit{Morph-GraphQL}) and other two that build materialized KGs at scale (\textit{SDM-RDFizer} and \textit{FunMap}). The second goal of this thesis is to define standard and objective methodologies to evaluate this new generation of KG construction systems. We present a benchmark for virtual knowledge graph access systems \textit{GTFS-Madrid-Bench}, a set of RML test-cases to evaluate the conformance of its engines and an analysis of the impact over the performance of different parameters during the construction of materialized knowledge graphs.

In order to achieve the first objective of this thesis, we need to tackle the following open research problems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The current heterogeneity in the number of declarative mapping specifications reduces the benefits of this approach for constructing knowledge graphs. Based on the W3C recommendation R2RML~\citep{R2RML}, and with the aim of providing support to other formats beyond relational databases, many new declarative mapping languages are proposed such as RML~\citep{dimou2014rml}, xR2RML~\citep{michel2015translation}, KR2RML~\citep{slepicka2015kr2rml}, CSVW~\citep{tennison2015model}, or D2RML~\citep{chortaras2018mapping}. Together with each specification their corresponding parsers have to be implemented, limiting their scope or generalizable optimizations, which negatively impacts on the global adoption of these data integration systems in real-world applications of knowledge graphs.

    \item The construction of virtual knowledge graphs from heterogeneous data sources (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML or RDB) does not exhibit good query evaluation performance nor completeness. The common technique is to use na\"ive SQL data wrappers that hidden the complexity of the input sources. However, in order to tackle the advantage of proposed SPARQL-to-SQL optimization techniques~\citep{priyatna2014formalisation,calvanese2017ontop}, well-formed RDB instances are required, including their corresponding domain and integrity constraints.

    \item Current approaches for constructing materialized knowledge graphs do not scale-up in complex data integration scenarios (e.g., high rate of duplicates or interoperability issues over the input data sources, high data volume, etc.). The absence of engines to efficiently parse declarative mapping languages to construct materialized knowledge graphs hinders their global and industry adoption over real use cases.
\end{itemize}

The second goal is focused on proposing evaluations of knowledge graph construction systems to understand what are their main current limits, and it has the following open research problems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The evaluations performed over materialization knowledge graphs engines are not representative neither general enough to provide an overview of the current limitations of the applied techniques. Engines such as RocketRML~\citep{csimcsek2019rocketrml} and SPARQL-Generate~\citep{lefranccois2017sparql} evaluate their features using their own use cases without information about their compliance with the mapping rules or representative performance and scalability evaluations. 
    \item The current virtual knowledge graph construction benchmarks~\citep{lanti2015npd,bizer2009berlin} are mainly focused on relational databases. Hence, they are not enough to test the capabilities of the new generation of engines that are able to run SPARQL queries over data in several formats. 
\end{itemize}



\section{Contributions to the State of the Art}
In this work, we aim to provide solutions to the open research problems described in the previous section.  The contributions for solving the first research problem are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{C1.1.}] \textbf{The concept of \textit{Mapping Translation} and its main properties}. 
    \item[\textbf{C1.2.}] The \textbf{formalization and application of constraints extracted from mappings rules and metadata over tabular data} to enhance virtual KG construction approaches. 
    \item[\textbf{C1.3.}] The exploitation of standard declarative mapping rules to automate the generation of functional wrappers. 
    \item[\textbf{C1.4.}] Definition of \textbf{physical operators exploiting information from mapping rules} for constructing materialized KG at scale.
    \item[\textbf{C1.5.}] \textbf{Heuristic-based optimizations for functional mappings} (mapping rules with transformation functions) for scaling up the construction of materialized knowledge graphs.
\end{enumerate}

With regard to the second objective, this work presents new contributions in the following aspects:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{C2.1.}] Definition of a set of test cases to test the conformance of KG construction engines in RML.
    \item[\textbf{C2.2.}] Identification and experimental evaluation of the parameters that affect the behavior of the KGC engines. 
    \item[\textbf{C2.3.}] A complete and representative benchmark for evaluating KGC engines, based on open data from the transport domain.
\end{enumerate}


Chapter \ref{chapter:mappig-translation} describes the mapping translation concept and its property, while Chapter \ref{chapter:virtual} provides the solutions to enhance virtual knowledge graph access over heterogeneous data exploiting the aforementioned concept. Chapter \ref{chapter:benchmark} describe a virtual knowledge graph construction benchmark in the transport domain, aligned with the second objective. Finally, Chapter \ref{chapter:construction} presents two approaches for scaling up the construction of materialized KGs together with evaluation methods for testing mapping compliance and performance in this process.

    \item The target schema (ontology) for integrating the source data is available, and is available in OWL.
    \item Mapping rules and metadata descriptions are available.
    \item Data are represented in formats that are not RDF.
    \item We do not have to consider data protection nor access restrictions.
    \item The size of datasets is XXXX.
