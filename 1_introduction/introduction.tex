\section{Thesis Structure}
\label{sec:thesisstructure}
The reminder of the thesis is organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In Chapter \ref{chap:soa} we analyze the current state of the art directly aligned with the topics of this work. Semantic Web and its main standard technologies for construction knowledge graphs, using declarative mapping languages and ontology-based data integration systems. We identify the limitations of the current approaches, which conduct the contributions of the presented work.
    \item In Chapter \ref{chap:objectives} we describe the objectives and main contributions of this thesis. Additionally, we present the assumptions, hypothesis and restrictions of the work.
    \item Chapter \ref{chapter:mappig-translation} defines the concept and properties of a new generation of knowledge graph construction systems, based on the idea of support semantic interoperability among the different types of declarative mapping specifications, what we call \textit{mapping translation}. Additionally, it provides a set of use cases where this idea has been already applied, with special focused on the construction of KG in the statistics domain.
    \item Chapter \ref{chapter:virtual} describes two proposals to optimize the construction of virtual knowledge graphs exploiting the concept of mapping translation. We first describe a set of optimization techniques to enhance completeness and performance of virtual knowledge graph access over tabular data. Second, we present a system that translates declarative mapping rules to programmed query endpoints for providing access to heterogeneous data sources.
    \item In Chapter \ref{chapter:benchmark} we present a comprehensive benchmark for virtual knowledge graph access, which considers multiple data formats and different data scales. Several engines from the state of the art are evaluated with this single benchmark so as to assess the current status of virtual knowledge graph access.
    \item In Chapter \ref{chapter:construction} describes a set of optimizations techniques over knowledge graph materialization approaches to provide scalability to the process. Additionally, two different studies evaluating the current status of these kinds of engines are also present.
    \item Finally, Chapter \ref{chap:conc} describes the main conclusions of this thesis and identified the future lines of research in the are of semantic data integration and knowledge graph construction.
