%Amount of data on the web, for example open data portals
Over the last years, a large and constant growth of data have been made available on the Web. These data are available in many different formats such as HTML tables, spreadsheets, PDF documents and web services. One of the most important and successful digital infrastructures that allows to governments, public institutions or non-profit organizations to provide a common and unique point where the data can be accessible by key stakeholders of the current societies (e.g, citizens, developers, private companies, etc.) are the open data portals. For example, at the time of writing, the European Data Portal\footnote{\url{https://www.europeandataportal.eu/catalogue-statistics/Evolution}} aggregates approximately 700K datasets from EU countries in a diversity of domains. In this context, the W3C organism has proposed a set of technologies and recommendations, which are the basis for Semantic Web, Linked Data, or the current hot topic, Knowledge Graphs. RDF~\citep{brickley1999resource} has been proposed as a standard format for data interchange on the Web, and RDF Schema~\citep{brickley2014rdf} and OWL ontologies~\citep{mcguinness2004owl} have begun to appear so as to provide shared models in some domains, while SPARQL~\citep{perez2009semantics} is defined as the standard query language for these data models. However, the amount of non-RDF data (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML) that are published in these open data portals continues to dominate the scene, and interoperability issues hinder their (re)use and consumption. 

%RDF y Semantic Web / Knowledge Graphs


Knowledge graphs have gained momentum as a result of the explosion of available data and the demand of expressive formalisms to integrate factual knowledge spread across various data sources~\citep{abs-2003-02320}. The number of hits per day of public knowledge graphs such as DBpedia\footnote{\url{https://wiki.dbpedia.org/blog/keep-using-dbpedia}} and Wikidata\footnote{\url{https://stats.wikimedia.org/}}, as well as the amount of scientific publications referencing these formal models\footnote{\url{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=knowledge+graph}}, provide evidence of the spectrum of opportunities that they are bringing into the industrial and scientific landscape. Although these results endorse the success of Semantic Web technologies, also exhort the development of computational tools to scale up knowledge graphs to the astronomical data growth expected for the next years.  


%Integración de datos basado en ontologias general
Data integration is not a new problem, it was already identified and addressed several decades ago with an emphasis on data in relational databases, but it is exacerbated by the availability of such data on the Web. Different techniques and tools have been used to address this problem~\citep{Lenzerini02,Halevy18}. In our work, we focus on those approaches based on ontologies and the use of Semantic Web technologies, what has been recently called knowledge graph construction (KGC). The basis of these approaches are, previously namely Ontology Based Data Access (OBDA)~\citep{poggi2008linking}, data consumers issue queries over a dataset according to a common unified view (an ontology). The relationship between the ontology and the data sources is usually available in the form of declarative mapping rules. In Ontology Based Data Integration (OBDI)~\citep{poggi2008linking}, these techniques are expanded to address heterogeneous datasets, whose data need to be integrated to provide answers to these queries. In both ontology-based approaches, two different alternatives exist to enable data access: (1) those where data are materialized taking into account the mappings and the ontologies (for example, data is transformed into RDF and loaded into a triple store, so that it can be queried using SPARQL), and (2) those where the transformation is done on the queries, which can then be evaluated on the original data sources. 


%Construcción de grafos de conocimiento de fuentes heterogeneas (mappings



Several benchmarks already exist in the state of the art of virtual knowledge graph access~\cite{bizer2009berlin,lanti2015npd}, as well as in SPARQL query federation~\cite{schmidt2011fedbench,hasnain2017biofed,montoya2012benchmarking}. The VKG access BSBM benchmark~\cite{bizer2009berlin} is focused on comparing the performance of SPARQL-to-SQL query translation versus the performance of native RDF Stores, and only considers VKG engines that access relational data stores. The NPD benchmark~\cite{lanti2015npd} specifically analyzes VKG access requirements related to datasets, query sets, mapping rules and query languages. In the area of federated SPARQL engines, existing benchmarks~\cite{schmidt2011fedbench,hasnain2017biofed,montoya2012benchmarking} are tailored to the context of SPARQL endpoint federation in an homogeneous format. As a result, none of these benchmarks address the requirement of virtualized access of multiple datasets available in heterogeneous formats. Additionally, VKG engines have been evaluated in an ad-hoc manner~\cite{endris2019ontario,mami2019querying} and to the best of our knowledge, no benchmarks have been developed to evaluate these proposals in a systematic manner.

\section{Thesis Structure}
\label{sec:thesisstructure}
The reminder of the thesis is organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In Chapter \ref{chap:soa} we analyze the current state of the art directly aligned with the topics of this work. Semantic Web and its main standard technologies for construction knowledge graphs, using declarative mapping languages and ontology-based data integration systems. We identify the limitations of the current approaches, which conduct the contributions of the presented work.
    \item In Chapter \ref{chap:objectives} we describe the objectives and main contributions of this thesis. Additionally, we present the assumptions, hypothesis and restrictions of the work.
    \item Chapter \ref{chapter:mappig-translation} defines the concept and properties of a new generation of knowledge graph construction systems, based on the idea of support semantic interoperability among the different types of declarative mapping specifications, what we call \textit{mapping translation}. Additionally, it provides a set of use cases where this idea has been already applied, with special focused on the construction of KG in the statistics domain.
    \item Chapter \ref{chapter:virtual} describes two proposals to optimize the construction of virtual knowledge graphs exploiting the concept of mapping translation. We first describe a set of optimization techniques to enhance completeness and performance of virtual knowledge graph access over tabular data. Second, we present a system that translates declarative mapping rules to programmed query endpoints for providing access to heterogeneous data sources.
    \item In Chapter \ref{chapter:benchmark} we present a comprehensive benchmark for virtual knowledge graph access, which considers multiple data formats and different data scales. Several engines from the state of the art are evaluated with this single benchmark so as to assess the current status of virtual knowledge graph access.
    \item In Chapter \ref{chapter:construction} describes a set of optimizations techniques over knowledge graph materialization approaches to provide scalability to the process. Additionally, two different studies evaluating the current status of these kinds of engines are also present.
    \item Finally, Chapter \ref{chap:conc} describes the main conclusions of this thesis and identified the future lines of research in the are of semantic data integration and knowledge graph construction.
