\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{chap:soa}

In this chapter, we introduce the current state of the art in knowledge graph construction using declarative mapping rules. We provide an overview of approaches, techniques and methodologies for constructing and querying (virtual) knowledge graphs based on semantic web technologies. We describe the declarative annotations and mapping languages specifications that have been proposed to construct these kind of data models together with their main benefits. Finally, we present the current methodologies to evaluate the quality of knowledge graph construction engines such as benchmarkings and test-cases.
